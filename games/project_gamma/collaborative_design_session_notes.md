# Starbound Voyager - Collaborative Design Session Notes

## Session Overview
Date: 2025-08-01
Participants: Developer & Game Designer Agent
Status: Core Vision & Combat System Exploration Complete

## Core Vision Established

### 1. Best Player Moment
**Vision**: Seeing run success leading to meaningful upgrades that add options/variety (not just power increases), plus upgrades to the universe/world itself.

**Key Points**:
- Upgrades should fundamentally change HOW you explore and gather resources
- Not just power increases - new options, ways to overcome challenges, varied experiences
- Upgrades to the universe/world unlock new content and experiences

### 2. Core Appeal - "Runaway Train" Feeling
**Vision**: Player feels out of control but finds control within each stop. Mystery destination adds narrative potential.

**Key Points**:
- Being on a runaway train going somewhere potentially amazing
- Finding measure of control within constraints
- Perfect for indie game storytelling and narrative
- Tension between helplessness and agency

### 3. Design Balance - Evolving POI System
**Vision**: Early game frustration becomes late game empowerment through POI evolution (like Path of Exile map shaping).

**Key Points**:
- Players can add more POIs between runs
- Influence what appears in different system types
- Specialization creates control over galaxy generation
- Transforms early limitations into progression goals

## Upgrade System Philosophy

### Exploration Upgrades Progression
- **Manual scanning** → **System-wide scans** → **Future system prediction** (1,2,3 systems ahead)
- Shows: star class, POI counts, time ranges, system modifiers
- Specialization upgrades increase certain POI types in specific star colors

### Resource/Gathering Upgrades
- New materials accessible through upgrades
- Exotic materials lock higher tier upgrades (upgrades lead to upgrades)
- New gathering, refining, utilization capabilities

### System Influence Mechanics
- Players CAN'T control ship's path in a run
- CAN influence probability of star colors, POI types, system effects through upgrades
- Example: Specialize in Blue star + moon mining = more of those spawn

### Progression Philosophy
- **Story progress separate** - required upgrades as story gates/tier unlocks
- **Upgrade paths create tension** - specializing locks out other paths or increases costs
- **Permanent per character upgrades**
- Examples: Moon breaking, deep core mining, probe scanning, scanning arrays

## Story & Progression Gates

### Story Gate Structure
- **Distance-based** progression with key encounters at specific jump numbers
- Key encounters reveal secrets about:
  - Ancient space-traveling alien race (derelict stations, ships, tech throughout galaxy)
  - Rogue AI drones (enemy threat, origins, purposes, mechanics)

### Specialization System
- **Soft locks** (increased costs, not hard blocks)
- Players can pursue multiple paths but must consider cost/benefit
- Option to overprep and grind more to access multiple paths

### Future System Prediction
- **Gradual information drip** that increases control feeling
- Never removes tension entirely
- Progressive revelation of system information

### Exotic Materials
- **RNG drops** from specific sources:
  - Specific asteroid types
  - Moon types
  - Anomaly types
  - Derelict alien ship/station salvage
- **Upgrades increase success chance up to 50%** (open to discussion)
- **Bad luck protection** ensures players don't go too long without rewards

## Combat System Design

### Combat Trigger & Flow
- **Some systems defended by rogue AI drones**
- **Upgrades reveal drone presence** in future systems (part of prediction system)
- **Drones don't attack immediately** - sometimes delayed
- **30-second warning** shuts down all ship operations for defense prep
- **Ship destruction = run over**

### Damage System Architecture
**Three-Layer Defense**:
1. **Shields** → **Armor** → **Hull**
2. Ship destroyed when hull HP reaches 0
3. **While shields hold**: Ship systems take NO damage
4. **While taking armor damage**: Ship systems have chance of damage
5. **While taking hull damage**: Much higher chance of system damage

### System Damage Consequences
Critical ship systems and their failure states:
- **Life Support offline** → Death timer starts
- **Drone Bay offline** → Can't launch mining drones
- **Sensors offline** → Can't run scans
- **Communication Array offline** → Can't send scanner probes
- **Primary Engines offline** → Can't jump (death if jump timer reaches 0)
- **Refinery offline** → Can't refine materials
- **Matter Processor offline** → Can't produce food + death timer

### Combat Mechanics
**Defensive Focus** (inspired by Wall World/Dome Keeper):
- **Defensive upgrades**: Shield strength, shield recharge speed, armor, etc.
- **Active abilities**: Different types of weapons and defensive tools
- **Energy system**: Powers combat abilities, part of upgrade progression

**Ability Types**:
- **Mouse-targeted weapons**: Fire at cursor location
- **Auto-targeting weapons**: Used on cooldowns
- **AOE abilities**: Energy pulses to damage/disable/disrupt
- **Energy management**: Strategic resource for combat abilities

**Enemy Variety & Learning**:
- **Visually different enemy types** with distinct behaviors
- **Damage immunities** and resistances
- **Attack patterns** players learn over time
- **Priority targeting** decisions (which enemies to focus first)
- **Enemy interactions**: Some buff others, time-sensitive threats

### Combat Upgrade Philosophy
- **Fully upgraded ship feels totally different to play**
- **Different upgrade paths = different ship experiences**
- **Potential specialization paths**:
  - **Fortress Build**: Heavy shields/armor, energy-efficient defense
  - **Evasion Build**: Fast recharge, mobility-based abilities
  - **Berserker Build**: Minimal defense, devastating offense

## Key Design Tensions Identified

### Resource Allocation Choices
- Repairs vs. immediate upgrades when systems are damaged
- Offensive upgrades (faster drone clearing) vs. defensive upgrades (safer exploration)
- System redundancy vs. specialization

### Time Pressure Integration
- Risk one more mining run before combat warning?
- Position for escape vs. commit to defensive stance?
- Finish critical upgrade before combat starts?

### Cross-System Synergies
- Damaged sensors could reduce weapon accuracy
- Life support upgrades extend death timers
- Drone bay upgrades could provide combat support

## Open Questions for Future Sessions

### Energy System Details
- How does energy regeneration work?
- Energy costs for different abilities?
- Energy upgrade paths and their trade-offs?

### Enemy Learning Curve
- How do players safely discover enemy weaknesses?
- Non-lethal intelligence gathering methods?
- Progression of enemy complexity?

### Ability Differentiation
- Should different ship builds have access to different ability types?
- How do specialization paths affect available combat options?

### Temporal Mechanics
- Should different builds affect jump timers differently?
- How do "drone nests" work for time pressure during combat?

## Next Session Priorities
1. Define energy system mechanics and upgrade paths
2. Explore enemy types and learning curve design
3. Detail ability specialization trees
4. Refine cross-system upgrade synergies
