# Starbound Voyager - Design Decisions Log

## Core Design Pillars (CONFIRMED)

### 1. Meaningful Upgrade Variety
- ✅ **Decision**: Upgrades change HOW you play, not just power level
- ✅ **Decision**: Upgrades affect both player capabilities AND universe generation
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Avoids "bigger numbers" trap, creates varied experiences

### 2. "Runaway Train" Control Tension
- ✅ **Decision**: Players can't control ship's path during runs
- ✅ **Decision**: Control comes through preparation and upgrade choices
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Maintains core tension while providing meaningful agency

### 3. Evolving POI System
- ✅ **Decision**: Early frustration becomes late empowerment
- ✅ **Decision**: Players influence probability, not direct control
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Path of Exile map shaping model works for this concept

## Progression System Decisions (CONFIRMED)

### Story Integration
- ✅ **Decision**: Distance-based story gates at specific jump numbers
- ✅ **Decision**: Story upgrades are required, unlock new tiers
- ✅ **Decision**: Story separate from optional upgrade paths
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Ensures narrative pacing while preserving player choice

### Specialization Philosophy
- ✅ **Decision**: Soft locks (increased costs) not hard locks
- ✅ **Decision**: Permanent per-character upgrades
- ✅ **Decision**: Specialization creates meaningful trade-offs
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Allows experimentation while creating tough choices

### Exotic Materials
- ✅ **Decision**: RNG drops from specific source types
- ✅ **Decision**: Upgrades increase success chance up to 50%
- ✅ **Decision**: Bad luck protection prevents frustration
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Excitement from discovery with protection against bad streaks

## Combat System Decisions (CONFIRMED)

### Combat Role & Trigger
- ✅ **Decision**: Situational challenge, not constant threat
- ✅ **Decision**: 30-second warning for preparation
- ✅ **Decision**: Upgrades reveal future drone presence
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Integrates with exploration focus and upgrade prediction system

### Damage & Systems
- ✅ **Decision**: Shields → Armor → Hull three-layer system
- ✅ **Decision**: System damage only occurs during armor/hull damage
- ✅ **Decision**: Critical systems have specific failure consequences
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Creates strategic depth and meaningful failure states

### Combat Mechanics
- ✅ **Decision**: Defensive focus inspired by Wall World/Dome Keeper
- ✅ **Decision**: Active abilities with energy system
- ✅ **Decision**: Enemy variety with learnable patterns
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Fits with time pressure and upgrade philosophy

### Upgrade Integration
- ✅ **Decision**: Different upgrade paths feel like different ships
- ✅ **Decision**: Specialization affects combat capabilities
- ✅ **Decision**: Cross-system synergies between combat and exploration
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Supports core pillar of meaningful upgrade variety

## Key Design Questions (OPEN)

### Energy System
- ❓ **Question**: How does energy regeneration work during combat?
- ❓ **Question**: Should energy capacity vs regeneration be separate upgrades?
- ❓ **Question**: How do different specializations affect energy systems?

### Enemy Design
- ❓ **Question**: How many enemy types for launch version?
- ❓ **Question**: Progression of enemy complexity through the journey?
- ❓ **Question**: Non-lethal ways to learn enemy weaknesses?

### Ability Trees
- ❓ **Question**: Should abilities be locked to specialization paths?
- ❓ **Question**: Shared abilities vs. specialization-exclusive abilities?
- ❓ **Question**: How do abilities scale with upgrades?

### Temporal Mechanics
- ❓ **Question**: Should different builds affect jump timer length?
- ❓ **Question**: How do reinforcement spawns work during combat?
- ❓ **Question**: Balance between preparation time and exploration time?

## Rejected Alternatives

### Combat Complexity
- ❌ **Rejected**: Pure action-based real-time combat
- ❌ **Reasoning**: Doesn't fit with exploration focus and time pressure

### Ship Path Control
- ❌ **Rejected**: Player choice of next system destination
- ❌ **Reasoning**: Breaks "runaway train" core appeal

### Hard Specialization Locks
- ❌ **Rejected**: Choosing one path completely blocks others
- ❌ **Reasoning**: Too restrictive, doesn't allow experimentation

### Guaranteed Exotic Drops
- ❌ **Rejected**: Predictable exotic material acquisition
- ❌ **Reasoning**: Removes discovery excitement and achievement feeling
