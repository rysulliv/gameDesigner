# Starbound Voyager - Project Status

## Project Overview
- **Working Title**: Starbound Voyager
- **Genre**: Top-down Space Roguelite / Exploration Survival
- **Platform**: PC (Steam)
- **Development**: Solo Developer
- **Current Phase**: Collaborative Design - Core Vision Complete

## Design Phase Progress

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Core Vision & Framework
- [x] **Core Design Pillars** - Meaningful upgrades, "runaway train" control, evolving POI system
- [x] **Progression Philosophy** - Soft specialization, distance-based story gates, exotic materials
- [x] **Combat System Framework** - Defensive focus, system damage, energy-based abilities
- [x] **Upgrade Integration** - Cross-system synergies, specialization paths defined

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Mechanical Details
- [ ] **Energy System Mechanics** - Regeneration, capacity, specialization effects
- [ ] **Enemy Design Details** - Types, complexity progression, learning curve
- [ ] **Ability Specialization Trees** - Paths, exclusivity, scaling
- [ ] **Temporal Balance** - Jump timers, combat duration, preparation time

### ‚è≥ PENDING - Future Design Areas
- [ ] **Resource Economy** - Material types, conversion rates, storage limits
- [ ] **POI Content Design** - Specific encounter types, rewards, challenges
- [ ] **Narrative Integration** - Story beats, discovery methods, pacing
- [ ] **Audio/Visual Direction** - Art style, UI design, audio systems

## Key Design Decisions Made

### Core Gameplay Loop ‚úÖ
1. **Arrival** - Ship jumps to new system with time limit
2. **Scanning** - Player discovers POIs (initially manual, upgrades to automated)
3. **Exploration** - Active piloting to gather resources and explore
4. **Combat** - Defensive encounters with rogue AI drones (if present)
5. **Management** - Resource allocation, upgrades, ship maintenance
6. **Jump** - Automatic progression to next system when time expires

### Upgrade Philosophy ‚úÖ
- **Meaningful not incremental** - Changes HOW you play
- **Universe evolution** - Upgrades affect what spawns in future systems
- **Soft specialization** - Paths have costs but aren't exclusive
- **Cross-system synergies** - Combat upgrades affect exploration and vice versa

### Risk/Reward Balance ‚úÖ
- **Time pressure** creates urgency without frustration
- **System damage** provides meaningful consequences
- **Exotic materials** balance RNG excitement with bad luck protection
- **Specialization trade-offs** create strategic depth

## Collaborative Process Status

### Design Partner Engagement ‚úÖ
- Game Designer Agent successfully activated
- Collaborative dialogue approach working well
- Core vision aligned and documented
- Open questions identified for future sessions

### Documentation Complete ‚úÖ
- Session notes captured
- Design decisions logged
- Project status tracked
- Ready to resume from current state

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Energy System Design** - Core combat resource mechanics
2. **Enemy Type Definition** - Variety, progression, learning curve
3. **Ability Tree Structure** - Specialization paths and ability access

### Medium Priority
1. **Resource Economy Balance** - Material scarcity and progression
2. **POI Encounter Design** - Specific content and rewards
3. **Narrative Beat Planning** - Story revelation pacing

### Low Priority
1. **Audio/Visual Concepts** - Style guide development
2. **UI/UX Planning** - Interface design principles
3. **Technical Architecture** - Engine choice and implementation

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Core vision is clear and compelling
- Combat system fits thematically
- Upgrade philosophy is well-defined
- Solo development scope is realistic

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Energy system complexity could affect balance
- Enemy variety might need significant content creation
- Ability tree complexity could overwhelm players

### High Risk üö®
- Resource economy balance critical to progression feel
- Story integration timing needs careful pacing
- Cross-system synergies could become too complex

## Development Readiness

### Ready for Technical Planning ‚úÖ
- Core gameplay loop defined
- Major systems identified
- Upgrade paths established
- Combat mechanics outlined

### Needs More Design Work ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Specific ability implementations
- Enemy behavior details
- Resource conversion systems
- POI content variety

### Not Ready Yet ‚ùå
- Art style specifics
- Audio design
- UI/UX implementation details
- Marketing positioning
