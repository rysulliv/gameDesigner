# Spirit Bound - Multiplayer Considerations

## Network Architecture Requirements

### Core Networking Approach

**Client-Server Architecture**: Dedicated servers for persistent world state management and authoritative game logic to prevent cheating and ensure consistent experience across all players.

**Hybrid Networking Model**:
- **Authoritative Server**: Handles all living player actions, resource states, and world persistence
- **Distributed Spirit Processing**: Spirit player actions processed with lower latency requirements
- **Synchronized State**: Both living and spirit realm states synchronized across all clients
- **Predictive Client**: Local prediction for responsive controls with server reconciliation

### Technical Infrastructure

**Server Requirements**:
- **Persistent World State**: 24/7 server availability for ongoing game worlds
- **Player Capacity**: Support for 4-8 concurrent players per instance
- **Instance Management**: Dynamic server allocation based on player demand
- **Data Persistence**: Reliable save/load systems for long-term progression

**Bandwidth Optimization**:
- **State Compression**: Efficient encoding of game state changes
- **Priority Systems**: Critical information (dangers, deaths) gets priority transmission
- **Delta Updates**: Only changes transmitted, not full state refreshes
- **Adaptive Quality**: Network quality affects update frequency, not core functionality

## Player Management Systems

### Session Continuity

**Drop-in/Drop-out Support**:
- **Seamless Joining**: New players can join existing sessions without disrupting gameplay
- **AI Takeover**: Temporary AI control of disconnected players to maintain team function
- **State Preservation**: Player progress and character state saved during disconnections
- **Flexible Team Sizes**: Content scales appropriately for 2-8 players

**Character Persistence**:
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Player progression and equipment persist between sessions
- **Multiple Character Support**: Players can have different characters in different worlds
- **Character Transfer**: Limited ability to move characters between compatible game worlds
- **Backup Systems**: Regular character state backups to prevent data loss

### Team Coordination Tools

**Communication Systems**:
- **Integrated Voice Chat**: Built-in voice communication with proximity and team channels
- **Spirit Communication**: Special channels for spirit-to-living and spirit-to-spirit communication
- **Visual Indicators**: In-game markers for pointing out resources, dangers, and objectives
- **Message System**: Persistent text messages for coordination when voice isn't available

**Coordination Interfaces**:
- **Shared Map**: Real-time map updates visible to all team members
- **Objective Tracking**: Shared task lists and progress indicators
- **Resource Sharing**: Clear indicators of who needs what resources
- **Skill Coordination**: Visibility into each player's specializations and current abilities

## Player State Management

### Living-Spirit Transitions

**Death State Synchronization**:
- **Instant Transition**: Immediate shift from living to spirit state without loading delays
- **State Preservation**: Player inventory, skills, and progress maintained across state changes
- **Visual Continuity**: Smooth animation and effect transitions for all players
- **Notification Systems**: Clear indicators to all players when state changes occur

**Resurrection Coordination**:
- **Resource Tracking**: Shared visibility of resurrection requirements and progress
- **Ritual Participation**: Multiple players can contribute to resurrection processes
- **Success Probability**: Clear indicators of resurrection attempt likelihood
- **Failure Handling**: Graceful handling of failed resurrection attempts

### Balance and Fairness

**Anti-Griefing Measures**:
- **Consensual Death**: Prevent intentional team killing through consent systems
- **Resource Protection**: Safeguards against malicious resource destruction
- **Vote Systems**: Team-based decisions for major actions affecting all players
- **Reputation Tracking**: Long-term player behavior tracking for matchmaking

**Skill Gap Management**:
- **Mentorship Tools**: Systems to help experienced players guide newcomers
- **Catch-up Mechanics**: Assistance for players who fall behind in progression
- **Role Flexibility**: Multiple ways to contribute regardless of skill level
- **Learning Supports**: In-game tutorials and guidance systems

## Social Features

### Community Building

**Guild/Clan Systems**:
- **Persistent Teams**: Long-term team formation with shared progression
- **Guild Bases**: Shared construction projects spanning multiple play sessions
- **Guild Events**: Special challenges designed for established teams
- **Mentorship Programs**: Experienced teams help new players learn cooperation

**Social Discovery**:
- **Player Matching**: Systems to connect players with compatible play styles
- **Skill-Based Matching**: Pairing players with complementary abilities
- **Friendship Systems**: Tools to maintain connections with good teammates
- **Community Features**: Forums, guides, and player-generated content sharing

### Cultural Development

**Shared World Elements**:
- **Server Communities**: Large persistent worlds with multiple active teams
- **Territory Systems**: Areas influenced by different teams' construction and activities
- **Cultural Exchange**: Teams can share discoveries and techniques
- **Legacy Features**: Long-term impact of team achievements on server history

**Player-Generated Content**:
- **Base Sharing**: Teams can showcase their construction achievements
- **Guide Creation**: Players can create and share cooperation strategies
- **Event Organization**: Community-organized tournaments and challenges
- **Story Sharing**: Tools for teams to document and share their adventures

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Synchronization Complexities

**Dual-Realm State Management**:
- **Challenge**: Maintaining consistent state between physical and spirit realms
- **Solution**: Layered state architecture with realm-specific and shared components
- **Implementation**: Separate but linked data structures with validation checks

**Cross-State Interactions**:
- **Challenge**: Managing interactions between living and spirit players
- **Solution**: Predictive interaction system with server validation
- **Implementation**: Local prediction for responsiveness, server correction for accuracy

**Latency Handling**:
- **Challenge**: Ensuring responsive spirit abilities despite network delays
- **Solution**: Client-side prediction for spirit actions with server reconciliation
- **Implementation**: Rollback networking for critical interactions, prediction for atmospheric effects

### Scalability Considerations

**Server Architecture**:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple server instances handle different game worlds
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic allocation of computational resources based on world activity
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient storage and retrieval of player and world data
- **CDN Integration**: Content delivery optimization for global player base

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Update Culling**: Only send relevant updates to each player based on their current needs
- **Compression Systems**: Efficient encoding of frequently transmitted data
- **Adaptive Networking**: Adjust update frequencies based on connection quality
- **Local Caching**: Client-side caching of static world data and assets
