# Spirit Bound
*A co-op survival crafting game with ghostly assistance*

## Core Information
- **Genre**: Co-op Survival / Crafting / Supernatural
- **Platform**: PC (Steam), Console (PlayStation, Xbox)
- **Target Audience**: 16-35, co-op gamers, survival crafting fans
- **Development Complexity**: 4/5

## Core Hook
Survive in a mystical wilderness where your deceased teammates return as helpful spirits. Dead players can manipulate the environment, scout ahead, and provide supernatural assistance while waiting for resurrection opportunities, making death a temporary strategic state rather than punishment.

## Unique Selling Proposition
- **Helpful Ghosts**: Dead players remain active as spirits with unique abilities
- **Spirit Powers**: Ghosts can move objects, reveal hidden resources, warn of dangers
- **Resurrection Mechanics**: Multiple ways to bring back teammates using rare resources
- **Spectral Crafting**: Spirits can assist with complex crafting recipes

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Daily Survival**: Gather resources, craft tools, build shelter as living players
2. **Spirit Assistance**: Dead teammates scout, manipulate environment, provide intel
3. **Dangerous Exploration**: Living players take risks while spirits provide safety net
4. **Resurrection Quests**: Work together to gather materials for bringing back spirits
5. **Base Building**: Construct both physical structures and spiritual anchors
6. **Seasonal Challenges**: Weather and supernatural events test team coordination

## Key Features
- **Asymmetric Co-op**: Living and dead players have different but complementary abilities
- **No Rage Quit**: Death keeps players engaged with meaningful spirit gameplay
- **Spectral Vision**: Spirits see hidden resources, enemy weaknesses, safe paths
- **Collective Progression**: All players (living and dead) contribute to team advancement
- **Cross-Realm Crafting**: Some recipes require both physical and spiritual manipulation

## Market Opportunity Assessment
**Very High Potential** - Co-op games made 36% of Steam revenue despite being only 6% of releases. Unique death mechanic solves major frustration in survival games where dead players wait helplessly.

## Technical Feasibility
- **Core Systems**: Multiplayer networking, survival mechanics, ghost state management
- **Advanced Features**: Dual-layer world (physical/spiritual), spectral interactions
- **Platform Considerations**: Voice chat essential for living/dead coordination
- **Performance**: Optimize for 4-8 players with persistent world state

## Revenue Model
- **Base Game**: Premium ($29.99-34.99)
- **Season Passes**: New biomes, spirit abilities, resurrection methods
- **Cosmetics**: Character customization, spirit appearances, base decorations

## Competitive Differentiation
Solves the "waiting when dead" problem that plagues most survival co-op games. More supernatural than Valheim, more cooperative than The Forest, unique spirit mechanics create new gameplay possibilities.

## Technical Requirements
- **Networking**: Reliable multiplayer for 4-8 players with persistent world
- **Dual State System**: Track both living player actions and spirit interactions
- **Environmental Physics**: Spirit manipulation of world objects and resources

## Social Features
- **Spirit Communication**: Special UI for dead players to communicate with living
- **Collective Goals**: Challenges that require both living and dead player participation
- **Memorial System**: Permanent monuments to commemorate fallen teammates

## Development Timeline Estimate
- **Prototype**: 6-8 months
- **Alpha**: 15-18 months
- **Full Release**: 20-24 months
