# Memory Heist
*An AI-powered extraction shooter in the digital mindscape*

## Core Information
- **Genre**: Extraction Shooter / Cyberpunk
- **Platform**: PC (Steam), Console (Future)
- **Target Audience**: 16-35, tactical shooter fans, cyberpunk enthusiasts
- **Development Complexity**: 4/5

## Core Hook
Teams infiltrate AI-generated digital minds to extract valuable memories before security systems delete them. Each "mind" is a procedurally generated level with unique architecture, defenses, and valuable memories hidden within.

## Unique Selling Proposition
- **AI-Generated Levels**: Every mindscape is unique, created by AI based on the "target's" personality
- **Memory Currency**: Extracted memories serve as both loot and crafting materials
- **Psychological Warfare**: Use extracted memories against enemies as debuffs/distractions
- **Adaptive AI Security**: Defense systems learn from player behavior and adapt

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Intelligence Phase**: Research target minds, plan extraction route
2. **Loadout**: Equip cyber-weapons and memory storage devices
3. **Infiltration**: Enter procedural mindscape with 2-4 player team
4. **Extraction**: Navigate defenses, solve memory puzzles, collect valuable data
5. **Escape**: Reach extraction point before security lockdown
6. **Processing**: Trade memories, upgrade equipment, research new targets

## Key Features
- **Procedural Mindscapes**: AI generates levels based on target personality profiles
- **Memory Mechanics**: Memories affect gameplay (childhood fears spawn monsters, happy memories create safe zones)
- **Team Synergy**: Different "hacker classes" with complementary abilities
- **Dynamic Threat Level**: Security increases as you extract more valuable memories
- **Persistent Progression**: Unlock new gear, abilities, and target profiles

## Market Opportunity Assessment
**Medium-High Potential** - Extraction shooters are trending (Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown), and AI-generated content appeals to tech-savvy audiences. Unique cyberpunk theme differentiates from military/horror settings.

## Technical Feasibility
- **AI Integration**: Use procedural generation algorithms for level creation
- **Core Systems**: Multiplayer networking, inventory management, AI behavior trees
- **Advanced Features**: Real-time level generation, memory-based environmental changes
- **Platform Considerations**: Requires robust multiplayer infrastructure

## Revenue Model
- **Base Game**: Premium ($29.99-39.99)
- **Season Passes**: New hacker classes, weapon skins, target mind categories
- **Cosmetics**: Character customization, weapon skins, extraction point themes

## Competitive Differentiation
Combines the tension of extraction shooters with the narrative depth of cyberpunk themes and the replayability of AI-generated content. Less punishing than Tarkov, more strategic than battle royales.

## Technical Requirements
- **Server Architecture**: Dedicated servers for fair play and cheat prevention
- **AI Systems**: Procedural level generation, adaptive enemy AI
- **Networking**: Low-latency multiplayer for 8-16 players per match

## Development Timeline Estimate
- **Prototype**: 6-8 months
- **Alpha**: 12-15 months
- **Full Release**: 18-24 months
