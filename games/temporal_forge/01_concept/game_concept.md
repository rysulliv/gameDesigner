# Temporal Forge
*A time-manipulation crafting survival game*

## Core Information
- **Genre**: Time-Manipulation / Crafting / Survival
- **Platform**: PC (Steam), Console (Future)
- **Target Audience**: 18-40, crafting enthusiasts, puzzle game fans
- **Development Complexity**: 5/5

## Core Hook
Survive in a world where time flows differently in various zones. Craft items that exist across multiple time states simultaneously, and manipulate temporal mechanics to solve survival challenges and create impossible constructions.

## Unique Selling Proposition
- **Multi-Temporal Crafting**: Items exist in past, present, and future states
- **Time Zone Survival**: Different areas have accelerated, slowed, or reversed time
- **Temporal Paradox Puzzles**: Use time manipulation to solve complex challenges
- **Causal Crafting**: Future items can influence their own creation in the past

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Temporal Scouting**: Explore zones with different time flow rates
2. **Resource Gathering**: Collect materials from multiple time periods
3. **Time-State Crafting**: Create items that exist across temporal states
4. **Survival Management**: Handle needs that change at different time rates
5. **Paradox Solving**: Use temporal mechanics to overcome survival challenges
6. **Base Construction**: Build structures that span multiple time zones

## Key Features
- **Time Acceleration Zones**: Areas where time moves at different speeds
- **Temporal Inventory**: Items age, decay, or improve at various rates
- **Causal Loop Crafting**: Create bootstrap paradoxes for impossible items
- **Time-Split Gameplay**: Actions in one time period affect others
- **Temporal Ecology**: Wildlife and environment change across time states

## Market Opportunity Assessment
**Medium Potential** - Highly innovative but complex concept may limit audience. Appeals to players who enjoy both crafting games like Subnautica and puzzle games like The Witness.

## Technical Feasibility
- **Complex Systems**: Multiple time simulation requires careful optimization
- **Core Features**: Time manipulation, state management, causal tracking
- **Advanced Features**: Visual representation of temporal effects
- **Platform Considerations**: High processing requirements for time simulation

## Revenue Model
- **Base Game**: Premium ($34.99-39.99) due to development complexity
- **DLC**: New temporal zones, advanced crafting recipes, story campaigns
- **Modding Support**: Community-created temporal puzzles and zones

## Competitive Differentiation
First crafting/survival game to meaningfully integrate time manipulation as core mechanic. More complex than typical survival games, more action-oriented than pure puzzle games.

## Technical Requirements
- **Time Simulation**: Multiple concurrent time states with different flow rates
- **State Management**: Track item states across temporal dimensions
- **Performance**: Optimize for complex temporal calculations

## Development Challenges
- **Design Complexity**: Balancing temporal mechanics without overwhelming players
- **Bug Prevention**: Time paradoxes could create infinite loops or crashes
- **Tutorialization**: Teaching complex temporal concepts accessibly

## Innovation Opportunities
- **Educational Applications**: Demonstrate time dilation and relativity concepts
- **Accessibility**: Visual and audio cues to help track temporal states
- **Community Features**: Share temporal puzzle solutions and base designs

## Development Timeline Estimate
- **Prototype**: 8-10 months
- **Alpha**: 18-24 months
- **Full Release**: 30-36 months
