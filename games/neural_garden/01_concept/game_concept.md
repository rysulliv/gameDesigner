- **Emergent Narratives**: AI generates unique stories about plant relationships and growth
- **Biometric Integration**: Optional heart rate, sleep, and activity data influence garden
- **Collaborative AI**: Plants learn from the global community while remaining personal

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Daily Check-in**: Visit garden, observe overnight growth and changes
2. **Interaction**: Water, prune, and interact with AI plants
3. **Story Moments**: Read generated narratives about plant relationships
4. **Garden Expansion**: Unlock new areas as plants reach maturity
5. **Sharing**: Export plant stories and garden photos to social media
6. **Community Events**: Participate in global garden challenges

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Plants**: Each plant develops unique traits from player interaction
- **Generated Stories**: AI creates narratives about plant growth and relationships
- **Mood Integration**: Garden reflects and responds to player's emotional state
- **Idle Progression**: Plants grow and interact even when app is closed
- **Photography Mode**: Capture and share beautiful AI-generated garden moments

## Market Opportunity Assessment
